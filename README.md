## Answers
The loan system I used is centralised since the bank itself is making the decision related to every aspect of lending money

Demerits of centralised:
1) Centralized management resembles a dictatorial form of leadership hence is unjust
2) The organizationâ€™s executives are under tremendous pressure to formulate decisions for the organization hence lack of work distribution
3) Employees at lower levels need to depend on the decision made by top management, which decreases productivity
4) feeling of slaves rather than organization employees
